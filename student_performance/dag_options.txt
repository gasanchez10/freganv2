1. Constraint-Based Methods

These rely on statistical tests of (conditional) independence.

PC Algorithm (Peter–Clark)
Iteratively removes edges based on conditional independence tests, then orients edges using logical rules. Works well if conditional independence tests are reliable.

FCI (Fast Causal Inference)
Extends PC to handle latent confounders and selection bias. Produces a Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG) instead of a fully oriented DAG.

GES / GIES (Greedy Equivalence Search)
Score-based but closely related—searches over equivalence classes using independence constraints.

2. Score-Based Methods

These assign a score to candidate graphs and search for the best-scoring DAG.

GES (Greedy Equivalence Search)
Greedily adds/removes edges to optimize a scoring function (e.g., BIC).

Bayesian Methods
Use priors over DAGs and compute posterior probabilities. Sampling methods (e.g., MCMC over DAG space, or order-MCMC) are often used.

Advantage: Robust to noisy CI tests.
Challenge: DAG search space is super-exponential, so heuristics are needed.

3. Functional Causal Model–Based

Exploit asymmetries in functional forms and noise distributions.

LiNGAM (Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model)
Identifies causal directions under linear relations with non-Gaussian noise.

ANM (Additive Noise Models)
If 
𝑌

𝑓
(
𝑋
)
+
𝑁
Y=f(X)+N fits well but not the reverse, infer 
𝑋

𝑌
X→Y.

Post-Nonlinear Models extend ANM with nonlinear distortions.

4. Hybrid Approaches

Combine independence tests and scoring.

MMHC (Max-Min Hill-Climbing)
First uses CI tests to find candidate parents, then refines using score-based search.

Balances efficiency with robustness.

5. Deep Learning & Continuous Optimization

Recent work relaxes the DAG constraint into a differentiable form and uses neural nets.

NOTEARS (2018)
Encodes DAG constraint via a smooth matrix exponential condition, enabling continuous optimization with gradient descent.

DAG-GNN (2019)
Uses graph neural networks to parameterize structural equations while enforcing acyclicity.

GraN-DAG, GOLEM, DCDI
Variants with better scalability or handling of nonlinear relationships.

6. Interventional Causal Discovery

When experimental/perturbation data is available:

ICP (Invariant Causal Prediction) exploits invariance of causal mechanisms across environments.

Joint methods (e.g., GIES) integrate observational + interventional data.
